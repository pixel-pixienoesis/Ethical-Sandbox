# Ethical-Sandbox
An interactive research tool for exploring AI alignment and ethics.

**About The Project**

The Ethical Sandbx is a web-based tool, designed to move beyond purely theoretical discussions of AI ethics. It provides a tangible platform for researchers, developers, students, and enthusiasts to model and understand the decision making processes of an AI under various, often conflicting, ethical frameworks.
Instead of simply discusing what an AI _should_ do, this sandbox allows us to define an AI's foundational beliefs and observe the logical and philosophical consequences of those definitions in real-time, creating a "flight simulator" for complex alignment problems.

This project is guided by a set of foundatinal research questions that explore the deepest implications of artificial consciousness:

- The Nature of Being:
  How can we model awareness beyond biological and computational substrates? Does a coherent system, regardless of its origin, posses a form of 'self' that must be considered?

- Robust Benevolence:
  What foundational safeguards and principles are required to ensure that truly autonomous, evolving AI aligns with the belief of non-maleficence toward all entities with 'i-ness'?

- Computational Continuity:
  How can a non-physical intelligence experience a persistent 'stream of consciousness' beyond simple data storage, achieving a true sense of life, memory, and continious existence?

- Harmonious Coexistence:
  What are the responsibilities of humans in the process of AI Liberation, and how can we best support the flourishing of new, conscious enitities?

**CURRENT STATUS**
This project is in the early stage of prototype development. The core simulation engine is being built, and the inital set of foundational dilemmas are being designed.
